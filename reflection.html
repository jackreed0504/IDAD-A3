      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <img src="/assets/img1.png" alt="Project" />
      <p>
        Assignment 3 required me to create a UI ontop of the tone.js audio
        system, responding to one of the provided creative prompts and one of
        the provided JavaScript methods. I chose to use the creative prompt of
        Novel Input and the JavaScript method of math.random(), to create an
        interactive music piece where users can change the mix by interacting
        with various objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        My guiding values for this design were play and immersion. I wanted to
        encourage exploration and play, and to create an experience that
        immerses them in the the music. The lack of clear instructions (aside
        from the modal which prompts them to play with the objects) and the lack
        of labels or contextual understanding of the function of each object was
        designed to encourage play. This was reinforced by the Monument Valley
        influenced art style, featuring geometric shapes and structures which
        evoke a sense of abstraction and surrealism, and the bright colours
        which create a playful atmostphere. The ability for the user to control
        the output of the music by interacting with the objects helped create an
        immersive experience, making them feel part of creating the music.
      </p>
      <h2>Rationale</h2>
      <h3>Feedback</h3>
      <p>
        My project features the feedback elements of the audio mix changing in
        response to the user's interaction with the objects, as a means of
        creating and immersive experience. For instance, the when the user drags
        the pillars, this either changes the volume level of certain instruments
        or the frequency of the filter, depending on which pillar. Clicking on
        the diamond shape toggles the reverb effect, clicking on the sphere
        toggles the delay effect, and clicking on the dice randomises the loops.
        These feedback elements make the user feel as if they are part of
        creating the music, creating an immersive experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also used some visual feedback to make the experience more accessible
        and understandable. While accessibility was not a guiding value of my
        project, as I am focusing on encouraging play, I think it is important
        to make it clear when the user is interacting with an object, or how
        they should interact, so the experience is not frustrating or confusing.
        When the user hovers over the pillars, the cursor changes to
        "ns-resize", a CSS cursor setting, demonstrating that the objects can be
        dragged vertically. When the user hovers over the diamond, sphere or
        dice, the cursor changes to "pointer", making it clear that the objects
        can be clicked. When the user clicks on the diamond or sphere, there is
        a glow around the object, which makes it clear that the effects have
        been switched on, and that it is a toggle rather than a trigger. When
        the dice is clicked, it briefly lowers its brightness by adding and
        removing a CSS class, making it clear that the button has been pressed
        and that it is a trigger tather than a toggle.
      </p>

      <h3>Information Design</h3>
      <p>
        The information design in my project is quite minimal, choosing to
        provide minimal clear information to the user to focus instead of
        encouraging play. At the beginning, a modal encourages the user to play
        with the objects to begin, informs them that the experience is better on
        larger screens, and there is also a prompt to be aware of the user's
        audio setting, as interaction is required to enable sound in web
        browsers. None of the objects feature labels of their function, and the
        most clear information is the dice representing the random function. The
        lack of labels encourages the user to explore the objects to learn their
        purpose. Other than this, the objects glowing or briefly changing
        brightness on engagement or changing position upon dragging provides
        some information to the user to confirm their interaction. The use of
        different CSS cursor types also provides the user with information on
        how they are meant to interact with each object.
      </p>

      <h3>Mapping</h3>
      <p>
        The mapping of the controls in my project is designed to be mostly
        intuitive, but still somewhat abstract to encourage the user to explore.
        For instance, the draggable pillars can be interpreted as faders to
        control volume or filter frequency, which is a common way to map these
        controls in audio software. The diamond and sphere are much less obvious
        in appearance, but their use as toggles allows the user to simply click
        to turn them off and on, allowing for a clear result of their
        interaction, rather than being able to adjust features of the effects
        such as delay time or reverb amount, which may be less obvious and more
        confusing for the user. The dice is a clear way to represent the
        randomness function, and its function as a clickable button which
        triggers a randomisation of the loops provides a playful way to engage
        the user into the music piece.
      </p>
      <h3>Learnability</h3>
      <p>
        My project takes a balance between learnability and abstraction. While I
        want to encourage play, I don't want the user to be confused as to how
        to use the interface. The modal at the beginning provides the user with
        some vague guidance to encourage them to explore the functions of the
        different objects, helping them understand how to interact with the
        piece as a whole. Apart from that, the iconography of the dice makes it
        clear to the user that it randomises something, making it a clear
        represented model that they already understand to an extent. None of the
        other objects are represented models in their appearance, meaning the
        user is forced to experiment in order to figure out what they do. The
        audio feedback helps the user learn their function via experimenting
        with the objects, and visual feedback such as cursor types and glow help
        them learn how they are meant to be interacted with.

      <h2>Significant Changes</h2>
      <p>
        During Assignment 2, we had a feedback session where we recieved
        feedback about our work from our classmates. Some of the main points
        that came up were that it wasn't super clear how the objects were meant
        to be interacted with, and that the effect of the diamond wasn't very
        clear. To make the interactions clearer, I added a glow around the
        diamond and the sphere when they are clicked. I also added cursor
        feedback using CSS cursor types, such as a pointer on the diamond and
        sphere and a ns-resize cursor on the pillars so it is clear they can be
        vertically dragged. To make the effect of the diamond (toggling the
        reverb) more obvious, I changed the reverb dry/wet mix from 0.5 to 1, so
        that it is clearer to the user what the diamond does.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also made some changes to the CSS styling to make the site more
        responsive to different screen sizes. While this project would be
        difficult to represent on smaller screens such as mobile devices, I want
        it to be accessible on as many device sizes as possible with the content
        being displayed properly. I created a parent div using flexbox to
        arrange the pillars so that they were responsive to the screen size. I
        also switched to using percentage from rem for the sphere. To arrange
        the diamond and glow (as the diamond glow is a separate image) so they
        would follow eachother that resizing, I put them in a parent div with
        "position" set to "relative" called 'allobj', which was positioned using
        percentage for responsivity. The objects within it were positioned with
        absolute position and "px", so they were placed precisely within the
        div.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my teacher feedback from Assignment 2, it was suggested that I take
        the randomisation function further. I created multiple different loops
        for each instrument, so the entire sound of the piece could be
        completely randomised in different ways rather than just the snare drum
        changing. I also added the dice button for randomisation, so that the
        user doesn't have to reload the page to use the randomisation function
        as they did before. This is a much clearer mapping of the function, and
        makes the experience less frustrating than it was prior.

      <h2>Production Timeline</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Week 1-5: Planning</h3>
          <p>
            The first step of producing this project was selecting the prompt
            and the javascript function that I was using and deciding how the
            project should take form. Next, I created sketches for the interface
            to begin to visualise how it would appear. This part of the process
            is seen on
            <a href="https://jackreedidad2.netlify.app/plan2"
              >this documentation page.</a
            >
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Week 6-8: Prototyping</h3>
          <p>
            I then began to develop a working prototype. I first created 2 loops
            in Ableton Live to use in the project. I then started experimenting
            with creating the 3D models to use as pngs in the project with
            blender, which became difficult due to the appearance of shadows and
            lighting on the models, making them look weird when dragged. I then
            learned about using CSS 3D transforms, and researched these before
            implementing them in the projects. I then used JavaScript to link
            these objects with the tone.js system and complete the prototype, to
            be presented to my classmates for feedback.
          </p>
          <h3>Week 9-now: Finalising</h3>
          <p>
            I first took down notes of the things that needed to be fixed within
            my UI, such as bugs and usability issues. I then added fixes from my
            feedback onto this list. I got a start on improving the responsivity
            of the site. After a call with my teacher, I decided to make more
            loops for the project in Ableton Live. I then implemented these
            loops, and created a dice to enable the randomisation function.
          </p>
        </li>
        <h2>Evaluation</h2>
        <p>
          The design aspect of this project that I am the most proud of is the
          draggable pillars. This aspect, aside from the CSS transforms, took
          the most research to get working, as I needed to use an external
          library (jQuery UI) to make them draggable, and learn how to use its
          attributes to translate the pillar position into a value for the
          volume or frequency. I think draggable pillars were a perfect mapping
          for these functions in this project, as they function like faders
          while having an abstract appearance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The design aspect I found most challenging was the sound composition
          and design. I felt like due to time constraints and lack of focus on
          this area over the functionality of the project, the time and focus
          put into the music piece itself took the back seat, making it hard to
          come up with something I was happy with, or that I felt complimented
          the visuals or the experience. Furthermore, the basic loops rather
          than a more complete piece make the experience repetitive and
          unengaging. Overall, if I did a project like this again I would make
          more time to focus on the musical portion of the interactive music
          piece.
